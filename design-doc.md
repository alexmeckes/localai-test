# AI Model Local Compatibility Checker Design Doc

## Problem Statement
Users need to determine if an AI model can run locally on their hardware. This involves gathering model specifications, analyzing hardware requirements, and providing clear recommendations.

## Solution Overview
A web application that combines model card analysis, hardware detection, and compatibility checking to give users clear guidance on local AI model deployment.

## Core Components

### 1. Model Information Service
- **Primary Data Source**: HuggingFace API
- **Data Extraction**: 
  - LLM-based parsing of model cards
  - Extracts: parameter count, memory requirements, framework, precision
  - Confidence scoring for extracted information
  - Fallback to manual entry when needed

### 2. LLM Integration
- **Interface Design**:
  - Provider-agnostic interface for LLM services
  - Initial implementation: Anthropic API
  - Future support: Local models (e.g., Mistral)
- **Extraction Process**:
  - Structured JSON output
  - Confidence scores per field
  - Source quotes for verification
  - Caching of common model analyses

### 3. User Interface
- **Basic Mode**:
  - Minimal required inputs
  - Common model presets
  - Simple yes/no compatibility answer
  - Basic optimization suggestions

- **Advanced Mode**:
  - Detailed hardware specifications
  - Custom requirements
  - Performance projections
  - Optimization strategies

### 4. Compatibility Engine
- **Hardware Analysis**:
  - Basic detection of system specs
  - Manual override options
  - Resource requirement calculations
